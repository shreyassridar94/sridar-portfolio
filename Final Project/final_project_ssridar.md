# Final Project
## Recycling in the US

## Part I
## Outline
For my final project, I want to create a data visualization story about the state of recycling in the US and how it can be improved. Local governments in the US collected garbage and recyclable waste from the residents and processed it at the materials recovery facilities(MRF). These facilities use manual labor and automated systems to sort the recyclables in the waste into different material types to recycle them and sell them in the market. The recyclable waste is collected in most of the places in the US through single stream recycling which means all types of materials are collected in the same bin. Even though, this reduces the cost of garbage collection, sorting these materials is very hard even with the use of automated robotic systems considering the high volume of trash. Hence, the unsorted trash was exported to other Asian countries such as China, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam. However, in 2018, China banned the import of trash from US that does not meet the required waste segregation standards. Similarly other countries followed China which has affected the US. With increasing municipal waste generation during the COVID-19 pandemic and the need to recycle the trash inside the country, many MRFs are turning to more labor and automated systems to sort the waste which increases the cost of recycling. This reflects in the high price of recycled material which discourages manufacturers from using it. As the number of customers for the recycled materials go down, the MRFs turn to landfills to dispose the trash which causes environmental damage. Hence, the US needs to adopt best practices from other countries to recycle its waste.

__Desired outcome of the story__:
I want the reader to see the story that waste recycling in the US will fail unless we change our recycling practices and behavior as well as fix local waste management systems. I want them to understand that what they are doing wrong so that they can change their habits and find ways to save the environment. After reading this story, I want them to share this information with others and contact their local representatives to act on the problem.

__Elements of the story:__
- Introduction: 
  - Environmental impact of waste generation and benefits of recycling along with current rate of recycling in the US for different material types.
- Current state of recycling in the US:
  - US export of trash to other countries over the years and how China's ban on import of trash is affecting the US
  - Increase in the volume of trash due to people staying at homes during the COVID-19 pandemic
  - Problems of single stream recycling, incorrect sorting of waste, increasing cost of recycled material whereas virgin materials are very cheap
- Improving recycling in the US:
  - Proper ways to recycle with examples of countries with best practices like Germany
  - Increase trends of new eco-friendly products and interest of people to buy such products
- Call to action: Change in recycling practices, methods and environment friendly product choices by the reader

## The Data
For the different elements mentioned above, I have found the following open data sources 
- Rate of municipal solid waste generation: [U.S. municipal solid waste generation 1960-2017](https://www.statista.com/statistics/186256/us-municipal-solid-waste-generation-since-1960/)
- Composition of municipal solid waste collected: [Municipal waste stream materials](https://www.statista.com/statistics/185710/us-materials-generation-in-the-municipal-waste-stream-since-1960/)
- Rate of recycling in the US: [Recovery of U.S. municipal solid waste for recycling from 1960 to 2017](https://www.statista.com/statistics/193923/recycling-of-us-municipal-solid-waste-since-1960/)
- Recycled paper use by purpose to show benefits of recycling: [Distribution of the utilization of recovered paper and paperboard in the United States in 2019, by type](https://www.statista.com/statistics/278261/us-recovered-paper-and-paperboard-utilization-by-type/)
- US export of trash: [UN Comtrade Database](https://comtrade.un.org/data/) 
- Increase in the volume trash during COVID-19 with New York City as the example: [Department of Sanitation New York(DSNY) Monthly Tonnage](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/DSNY-Monthly-Tonnage-Data/ebb7-mvp5)
- Incorrect sorting of waste and problems with single stream recycling with New York City as the example: [DSNY Waste Characterization: Mainsort](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/DSNY-Waste-Characterization-Mainsort/k3ks-jzek) and [DSNY Waste Characterization: Comparison Table](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/DSNY-Waste-Characterization-Comparison-Table/sx92-yn4a)
- [U.S. municipal solid waste generation and discards from 1960 to 2017 (in million tons)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/219791/us-municipal-solid-waste-generation-and-discards/)
- Materials discarded in landfills: [Amount of municipal solid waste landfilled in the U.S. in 2017, by material](https://www.statista.com/statistics/503958/municipal-solid-waste-discarded-in-the-us-by-material/)
- [Recycling stats of Germany](https://www.bmu.de/en/topics/water-waste-soil/waste-management/waste-management-statistics/general-waste-management/)

Some more data sources need to be identified for some elements like price of recycled materials, public interest towards recycling and current recycling practices.

## Method and Medium
I am planning to make the data visualizations using Tableau. By incorporating the concepts from the book [Good Charts Workbook: Tips, Tools, and Exercises for Making Better Data Visualizations](https://store.hbr.org/product/good-charts-workbook-tips-tools-and-exercises-for-making-better-data-visualizations/10209) by Scott Berinato, I want to create persuasive visualizations that make effective use of color with clarity using the appropriate charts. 

To present the story in a webpage format, I am going to use [Shorthand](https://shorthand.com/) as it allows for immersive and engaging story telling experience. Also, the platform is user-friendly for beginners like me with no prior experience in designing and coding webpages. To help me plan the story, I used the story arc method as mentioned above which helped me identify the different elements of the story that are required. Also, I will be using wireframes to build the visualizations and get feedback and critique from others. Based on the feedback, changes will be made to the visualizations. A presentation based on the Shorthand story will be made by me at the end of the project.

## User Research

### Protocol

Target Audience: For my data visualization story, I identified people living in residential houses as the audience. Through this story, I want to bring light on the current state of recycling in the US, the macro effects in the waste management industry and the effect of their actions on the recycling process.

Identifying representative individuals: Pittsburgh is diverse in its population with university students and working professionals. For a representation of all types of audience, I identified a graduate student studying at CMU, a working professional currently residing at Chicago.
