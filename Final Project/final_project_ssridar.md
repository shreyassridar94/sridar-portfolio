# Final Project

## Outline
For my final project, I want to create a data visualization story about the state of recycling in the US. I want the reader to see the story that waste recycling in the US will fail unless we change our recycling practices and behavior as well as fix local waste management systems.

In the past, local governments in the US collected garbage and recyclables from the residents and processed it at the materials recovery facility. These facilities used manual labor and automated systems to sort the recyclables in the waste into different material types to recycle them and sell them in the market. The recyclable waste is collected in most of the places in the Us through single stream recycling which means all types of materials are collected in the same bin. Even though, this reduces the cost of garbage collection, sorting these materials is very hard even with the use of automated robotic systems considering the high volume of trash. Hence, the   


## Initial Sketches
The sketch below shows the story arc of the data visualization

__Elements of the story:__
- Environmental impact of waste generation and benefits of recycling along with current rate of recycling in the US for different material types.
- US export of trash to other countries over the years and how China's ban on import of trash is affecting the US
- Increase in the volume of trash due to people staying at homes during the COVID-19 pandemic
- Problems of single stream recycling, incorrect sorting of waste, increasing cost of recycled material whereas virgin materials are very cheap
- Proper ways to recycle with examples of countries with best practices like Sweden
- Increase trends of new eco-friendly products and interest of people to buy such products
- __Call to action__: Change in recycling practices, methods and environment friendly product choices by the reader



## The Data
For the different elements mentioned above, I have found the following open data sources 
- US export of trash: [UN Comtrade Database](https://comtrade.un.org/data/) 
- Increase in the volume trash during COVID-19 with New York City as the example: [Department of Sanitation New York(DSNY) Monthly Tonnage](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/DSNY-Monthly-Tonnage-Data/ebb7-mvp5)
