# Critique

## Assignment 3 & 4

### Data Visualization Chosen
For this assignment, I chose the following data visualization available in the [sustainability](http://sustainability.tamu.edu/why-4-d.aspx) initiative of the Texas A & M University(TAMU). As part of the initiative, members of TAMU take a pledge to eat more vegetarian meals instead of meals with meat to reduce the carbon footprint of what they eat.

This chart serves the purpose of informing the audience about the high carbon footprint of meat products. It represents two types of data:
- The amount of CO2 emitted in Kg per Kg of food type consumed (represented by data labels)
- A mid-size car driving distance equivalent to the emissions from consumption of 110g (a single serving) of a food type (represented by bar chart)

The audience for the chart includes all members of TAMU, especially people who eat meals with meat. 

### Data Visualization Critique
I used Stephen Few's [Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf) to critique the data visualization I chose. This method of critiquing analyzes the visualization using 7 measures:
- <u>Usefulness</u>: How useful is the information provided in the visualization?
      When analyzing the chosen chart, I find that the information represented and provided in it are useful for the audience to understand the impact of meat products on the greenhouse gas emissions. But the chart could have been more useful if it could have presented the CO2 emissions of popular meals instead of the ingredients.
- <u>Completeness</u>: Does the visualization provide complete information about the visualization?
