# Critique

## Assignment 3 & 4

### Data Visualization Chosen
For this assignment, I chose the following data visualization available in the [sustainability](http://sustainability.tamu.edu/why-4-d.aspx) initiative of the Texas A & M University(TAMU). As part of the initiative, members of TAMU take a pledge to eat more vegetarian meals instead of meals with meat to reduce the carbon footprint of what they eat.

This chart serves the purpose of informing the audience about the high carbon footprint of meat products. It represents two types of data:
- The amount of CO2 emitted in Kg per Kg of food type consumed (represented by data labels)
- A mid-size car driving distance equivalent to the emissions from consumption of 110g of a food type (represented by bar chart)

The audience for the chart includes all members of TAMU, especially people who eat meals with meat.
