# Critique

## Assignment 3 & 4

### Data Visualization Chosen
For this assignment, I chose the following data visualization available in the [sustainability](http://sustainability.tamu.edu/why-4-d.aspx) initiative of the Texas A & M University(TAMU). As part of the initiative, members of TAMU take a pledge to eat more vegetarian meals instead of meals with meat to reduce the carbon footprint of what they eat.

This chart serves the purpose of informing the audience about the high carbon footprint of meat products. It represents two types of data:
- The amount of CO2 emitted in Kg per Kg of food type consumed (represented by data labels)
- A mid-size car driving distance equivalent to the emissions from consumption of 110g (a single serving) of a food type (represented by bar chart)

The audience for the chart includes all members of TAMU, especially people who eat meals with meat. 

### Data Visualization Critique
I used Stephen Few's [Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf) to critique the data visualization I chose. This method of critiquing analyzes the visualization using 7 measures:
- __Usefulness__: How useful is the information provided in the visualization?
      When analyzing the chosen chart, I find that the information represented and provided in it are useful for the audience to understand the impact of meat products on the greenhouse gas emissions. But the chart could have been more useful if it had presented the CO2 emissions of popular meals instead of the ingredients.
- __Completeness__: Does the visualization provide complete information about the visualization?
      The chart gives more information than required with 2 different types of data, which essentially tell the same information. Also, It provides information about most of the food types. But it could have been better if it had presented the CO2 emissions of the popular meals.
- __Perceptability__: How easy is it to perceive the visualization with minimal effort?
      The chart scores poorly for its perceptability due to the multiple colors used which make it harder to focus on the right information. Also the leader lines used to denote the food type on the bar charts are difficult to follow. The data presented as a comparison to a mid-sized car journey is difficult to understand.
- __Truthfulness__: What is the degree upto which the visualization is true and accurate?
      The chart is accurate in representing the data and I find no inconsistencies in the visualization.
- __Intuitiveness__: How easy is it to understand what the visualization is communicating?
      The chart type used is a bar chart which is familiar. But the data represented is not intuitive to understand as the consumption of 110g of food is compared against a car journey. Also, it does not explain clearly on how to interpret.
- __Aesthetics__: How is the aesthetic quality of the visualization?
      The use of multiple colors is causing a distraction for the eye. Also, the leader lines for each label are difficult to follow and makes the visualization look clumsy
- __Engagement__: Does the visualization lead the audience to learn more about the topic?
      Due to the poor layout of the chart and multiple colors used, the visualization does not engage the user. Significant effort is required from the user to understand the chart which leads to poor engagement.
      
### Redesigning the Data Visualization
Based on my learnings from critiquing this visualization, I created wireframes to redesign for a better visualization. I showed these wireframes to 2 other people to get feedback which further helped to shape the design through multiple iterations.

**Iteration 1:**

__Feedback:__
- The representation of red meat with red color is good
- The list of food types is too long
- Not able to understand why there is a car illustration only in the bar for lamb
- The empty space in the chart is powerful
- Difficult to understand the logic of the comparison data
- Intended audience: People who eat meat, Meat industry, Policy makers
- Suggested Changes: Make a better analogy for the car driving distance; Chart title could be redone and font size could be changed
- Changes implemented: New title narrative and corresponding label highlight, scale for x-axis and the rewritten data description to provide clarity

**Iteration 2:**

__Feedback:__
- The x-axis scale is helpful but the analogy is difficult to perceive
- Changes Implemented: Data representation in terms of actual CO2 emission per kg of food

__Feedback:__
- The data representation is clear
- Too much of red color indicates a strong message. Considering the audience of meat-eaters, the idea conveyed by the visualization may be too strong
- The narrative is not intuitive with the descending order of CO2 emissions data
- Changes made: Narrative changed back to iteration 1

__Feedback:__
- The visualization is simple and understandable.
- The narrative is not too strong and it can motivate meat-eaters to change into a vegan by starting with reducing red meats
