This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

# About me
I am currently doing my master's in [Integrated Innovation for Products & Services](https://www.cmu.edu/iii/degrees/miips/). I love to build products. I brainstorm a lot to find opportunities for innovation. Through my graduate education, I am learning how to understand user needs, ideate innovative solutions and create the right product/service which is desirable, feasible and viable. I aspire to become a product manager. Prior to my masters, I worked with [Ashok Leyland](https://www.ashokleyland.com/), India for 2.5 years in the product development team as a design engineer of exhaust and after-treatment systems for commercial vehicle engines.

# What I hope to learn
With massive amounts of data being collected everywhere in the world, it is important for us to analyze it and find meaningful insights to make good decisions. And to find these insights, we must know how to look the data. Visualizations come to our help in this regard. But one needs to be careful to do it in the right way and convey a story that will help us move closer to make a decision. Through this course, I want to learn the good practices of visualizing data and communicate insights that can help make the right decisions.
